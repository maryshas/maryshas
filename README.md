## Hi there 👋 Welcome to Mary's Portfolio!

## 🚀 About Me
👩🏻‍🎓 I'm a graduating senior at Ohio State University, majoring in Computer Science. I specialize in Data Analytics and minor in Business.

👩🏻‍💻 I work as a Facilities Data Assistant at Ohio State University's Facilities Information and Technology Services. My main responsibilities include collecting data, cleaning datasets, creating visualizations using Tableau to track key performance metrics, and generating reports using Microsoft Power Query.

💡 Recently, I've developed a passion for Data Analytics. I've completed a database and data mining course, where I learned how to design a database system, clean datasets, classify and cluster data, and formulate conclusions based on the results. Currently, I’m participating in a Project Series hosted by the Big Data and Analytics Association, where I work on personal technical projects while attending bi-weekly workshops. These workshops focus on statistical analysis, advanced visualizations, feature engineering, storytelling, and dashboarding.

🔎 Working style: I’m a fast learner who thrives on taking on new challenges and stepping outside my comfort zone. For example, at my current workplace, I embraced the opportunity to redesign the FITS Summary Stats Dashboard, even though I initially lacked experience with data visualization and Tableau. To succeed, I took a Tableau course and explored examples of great visualizations. This effort helped me create a dashboard that impressed my managers and added real value to our team. Furthermore, I value teamwork and open communication, so I always ask follow-up questions to ensure I fully understand my manager’s expectations and deliver exactly what’s needed for each project.

💌 Fun fact: I love reading. Currently, I'm reading the Twisted Series by Ana Huang and The Courts of Thorns and Roses by Sarah G. Maas. I also enjoy being in nature, hiking, traveling, and trying new foods.
