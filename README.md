## Hi there üëã Welcome to Mary's Portfolio!

## üöÄ About Me
üë©üèª‚Äçüéì I'm a fresh graduate from The Ohio State University with a major in Computer and Information Science. I specialized in Data Analytics and minor in Business.

I‚Äôm passionate about turning raw data into clear, actionable insights. In my role as a Facilities Data Assistant at Ohio State University, I‚Äôve worked with Tableau and Microsoft Power Query to track performance metrics, build dashboards, and generate reports that drive decision-making.

Beyond work, I‚Äôve strengthened my skills through coursework in database design and data mining, as well as hands-on projects with the Big Data and Analytics Association, exploring statistical analysis, advanced visualizations, and storytelling with data. I thrive when taking on new challenges, like when I taught myself Tableau to redesign a performance dashboard that impressed my managers and added real value to the team.

I‚Äôm excited to keep growing as a data professional and to contribute my skills, curiosity, and drive to teams that value data-driven decision-making.

üíå Fun fact: I love reading. I also enjoy being in nature, hiking, traveling, and a big foodie.
